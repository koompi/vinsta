remove SSH Known Host after install the OS in short after stop the vm when finished install, and when calling start_vm()
we remove ~/.ssh/known_host and the contain IPaddress of the virtual machine


 implement ssh argument, vinsta --ssh

 it will ask vm name and if never ssh before, it will ask for username and password

 it will build ssh  command and also save it for later, next time,  just write vm name and it will ssh into it, ofc, need
 to input password.
